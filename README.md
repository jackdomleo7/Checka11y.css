# Checka11y.css

**A CSS stylesheet to quickly highlight a11y concerns.**

The first line of defence for testing accessibility.

Designed to quickly highlight some common accessibility errors and warnings that can be easily and quickly rectified.

Recommended before turning to automation tools and scanners such as Lighthouse on Chrome.

Remember not to push this to production!

A great tool for:

- Websites and web applications to begin improving their accessibility.
- Developers and testers/QA to learn more about accessibility and creating accessible websites and applications.

_Lightweight_ &bull; _Modern_ &bull; _Accessibile_ &bull; _Customisable_ &bull; _Simple_

**BETA coming soon!**

## Why is accessibility important?

Accessibility is important to ensure your website or web application is accessible to as many users and types of users you can cater for.

Often, we can improve the accessibility on our websites and web applications by focusing on the obvious first - these are small quick wins that are easy to implement or rectify and may not require a lot of time investment.

Checka11y.css will instantly highlight as many HTML validity and HTML semantic errors and warnings as we can, to help you to improve your website or web application.
