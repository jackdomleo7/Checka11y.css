- [ ] I have thoroughly read the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
- [ ] I understand my pull request will be thoroughly reviewed at high detail.
- [ ] I understand the work in my pull request will **only** be available in the next version release of Checka11y.css and not in the current version release.
- [ ] I confirm the work in this pull request is valid according to my findings and is not something for anything personal.
- [ ] I have updated the [README](../README.md) and/or [features.md](../features.md) where and if applicable (still put an `x` if you have considered this but thought there was nothing to add or modify).
- [ ] I have added myself to the `contributors` section in `package.json` (still put an `x` if you have considered this but decided not to add yourself).
- [ ] I have checked I have **not** committed any **accidental** files.
- [ ] I have tested all the main modern browsers (I.e. Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari - please leave this unchecked if there were any browsers listed you could not test and list them in the [help](#help) section with details why you couldn't test that browser)
- [ ] I have run the automated tests and added new ones to cover new code.
- [ ] All new and existing a11y checks still work correctly (compare your local `test/index.html` to the `test/index.html` in the `master` branch).

## Help
<!-- Please provide any details here that you require any further help or assistance with. -->
<!-- E.g. I could not test in Safari because I do not have access to an Apple device. -->
